# Template for Pandoc

Write your stuff in the markdown files.

You will need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a latex distribution. On Windows you can get [miktex](https://miktex.org/).

To build use `bash build.sh`. On windows you can use [babun](http://babun.github.io/) to get a Bash shell

Check the examples in the `.md` files for how to use stuff like figures, math, tables, citations, footnotes.

Notice that the `md` files are ordered with a prefix of digits. This tells pandoc how to sort the files.
